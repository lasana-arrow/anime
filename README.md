<p>Wordpress Theme written for Russel D Jones and her website Nekoparade</p>
<p>Has specific post type ANIME with some meta-values and some taxonomies</p>
<p>Has specific post type Block with numerous taxonomies and meta values</p>
<p>Has complexed search and sorting based on different combinations of meta values and taxonomies</p>
<p>Has some shortcodes for presenting blocks and animes</p>
<p>Can be used to make an encyclopedia of different videos or films or animations or books (where you have the WHOLE art object as an object and parts of it as also art object) </p>
<p>Going to rewrite it to make a plugin of this instead of theme</p>
